## What is it?
- Not a CSS framework
- Just simple set of CSS
- It does not uses any UI framework
- Its for getting you started with a Mobile / Web application
- Can be used along with your favorite CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, MaterializeCSS, etc.
- The goal is to create something very light weight for MVPs and small applications and extend it for real applications
- Ofcourse, it is responsive on Mobile and Web

Note: However this is build on Meteor, but the CSS/JS can be used in any project and is independent of Meteor platform or Meteor's default templating language (eg: Blaze) which was an essential goal in order to built using React or AngularJS with their own template syntax.
